Tonight my girlfriend is coming over, i hope i can get rid of my brother so we have the house to ourselfs.


Bugfix
----------

views with h1, h2, h* threw a parse error exception. Because i was looking for tags with only characters (and the h* tags have numbers as well!)


Release
----------

release 0.2.0 to npm

i moved to 0.2 because the project is maturing and getting less experimental!
