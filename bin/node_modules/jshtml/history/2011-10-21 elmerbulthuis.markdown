==========

Very cold outside today, but also sunny...


Bugfix / new feature
----------

A stack overflow occured when using jshtml with express. Added some tests for testing an entire website with zombie so we can test if jshtml works nicely with those websites and express. That will prevent these kind of errors in the future.


Release
----------

release 0.1.7 to npm
